# resume_app

This is a simple resume app built with Dart and Flutter.(Always a work in progress)
The application contains a homepage, a simple skill comparison with indicators, a small yet concise information about my educationo and work history so far and a project section that takes you to my various repositories.

My Code base has the following breakdown:
- The Source code has four main screens which are found in the pages directory,
- The screens are the homepage, skill section, history and project sections,
- Widgets such as the Appbar,etc repeat themselves throughout the codebase so they were extracted and placed into the widget.dart file,
- A bottom nav was positioned on the homepage for easy navigation as it is the index, and
- a sidenav is placed with a drawer containing my contact information and social links.
